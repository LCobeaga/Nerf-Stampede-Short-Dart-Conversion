# Nerf Stampede Short Dart Conversion

This file set is an almost drop in kit to convert the nerf stampede from firing full length darts to a sealed breech short dart firing blaster. 

## Hardware

- Aluminum 16mm OD barrel with flanged edge
- M3 x 5mm threaded insert
- M3 x 5mm or longer machine screw
- o-ring for pusher seal to barrel (I used these https://outofdarts.com/products/xyl-unicorn-replacement-o-ring-upgrade)
- Wire
- Battery connector of choice

optionally 
- 5mm x 20mm metal dowel
- o-eing from Worker Stampede 9kg upgrade kit

## 3d Printing

The printed parts should be in the above orientation, with the Pusher, Barrel Holder, and Mag Tooth being the only parts with "Support on build plate only" turned on, all other parts require no supports. 

The mag adapter has a sacrifical wall on the back side that should be cut out after printing. 

## Assembly

1. Open up the blaster and remove all the pieces shown above and the screws that hold them in.
Keep the screws for the dart gate and the mag release, everything else can be thrown away.
   
3. Remove the plunger cover plate and the return spring rest so you can take out the plunger tube assembly.
Reinstall the return spring rest, and keep the return spring, the plunger cover plate, and the screws for the cover plate for later.

4. Using a rotating pipe cutter (or a saw) cut off the full length breech of the stampede at the inset where the orange plastic meets with the black(or grey) plastic. 
Shown above is what the cut off remainder should look like, and this piece can be thrown away

5. Using a soldering iron or pliers, push the thereaded insert into the hole at the top of the Barrel Holder.
Make sure it doesnt get in the way of pusshing the aluminum barrel all the way through the barrel holder.

7. Push the Pusher into the hole at the front of the plunger tube assembly (it might need to be deburred).
It is very important that the pusher is centered with the barrel, so test fit the assembly in the blaster and use shims (I used painters tape) to align the pusher. 
You can use a little hot glue on the underside of the flange to create a better seal once it is aligned.

8. Place the Mag Tooth into the back of the Mag Adapter and place the assembly into the blaster.
The Mag Adapter will lock over a small feature in the side wall of the stampede and the Mag Tooth will slot into the same screw posts as the original, as can be seen in the above photo.
There is a small exterior cosmetic piece that will lock into the new mag tooth from the outside, make sure to screw that in as it done from inside the blaster. 

10. Now would be a good time to rewire the blaster and replace the white trigger lever with the printed one.
Note that this means the blaster does not have any form of cycle control, this is because when using a 4S battery the blaster can have runaway firing issues.
If you can impliment motor braking the printed trigger lever does not need to be installed and the stock lever can be used.

10. Screw the barrel holder in place with the dart gate screws, place the aluminium barrel into the barrel holder, and align it with the mag adapter as shown in the photo above.
Once aligned tighten the M3 screw that goes into the threaded insert to lock the position of the aluminum barrel.
Make sure the screw is really tight as the stampede firing is very violent and can push the barrel back out of alignment.
   
11. Install the o-ring around the end of the pusher, place the pusher return spring over the pusher, and install the plunger tube assembly by angling it in pusher first.
Now would be a good time to lubricate the o-ring a little and do any plunger rod or spring modifications.
On my personal blaster I used two wraps of teflon tape, the o-ring from the worker 9kg spring kit, and a 12kg longshot spring.

12. Install the plunger assembly cover and the spring for the magazine release.

13. Install the Mag Lever using a 5mm dowel.
A 3d printed dowel is included in the file set, but the Mag Adapter was designed with a steel 20mm x 5mm dowel in mind.
The blaster should appear as in the photo above.

14. At this point the blaster modification is complete, but I suggest upgrading the spring in the catch.
The catch spring is accessed by removing the two screws that hold down the cover plate.

## Notes
When closing up the blaster the left side of the original pull-type mag release can catch on the new Mag Tooth, and if there is too much pressure the mag tooth will bind. 
If this happens use a razor blade to shave some material from the inside of the square cutout so the two sides mesh. 
You can also just remove the left side of the mag release if you only intend to use the lever mag release or the right hand side of the pull-type mag release. 

A battery upgrade is necessary for the blaster to function, personally I went for a 4S LiPO battery, which has more than enough room if the battery tray is modified.
The 4S battery gives me a good rate of fire with the 12kg spring, though a tougher spring is still definitely an option if I choose to upgrade. 

A lot of the hardware used it stuff I had lying around, so I included the step file of all components so anyone can easilt modify components to work better with parts on hand.
