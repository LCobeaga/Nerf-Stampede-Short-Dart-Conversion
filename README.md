# Nerf Stampede Short Dart Conversion

This file set is an almost drop in kit to convert the nerf stampede from firing full length darts to a sealed breech short dart firing blaster. 

## Hardware



## 3d Printing

The printed parts should be in the above orientation, with the Pusher, Barrel Holder, and Mag Tooth being the only parts with "Support on build plate only" turned on, all other parts require no supports. 

The mag adapter has a sacrifical wall on the back side that should be cut out after printing. 

## Assembly

1. Open up the blaster and remove all the pieces shown above and the screws that hold them in.
Keep the screws for the dart gate and the mag release, everything else can be thrown away.
   
3. Remove the plunger cover plate and the return spring rest so you can take out the plunger tube assembly. Save these parts and screws for later.

4. Using a rotating pipe cutter (or a saw) cut off the full length breech of the stampede at the inset where the orange plastic meets with the black(or grey) plastic. 
Shown above is what the cut off remainder should look like, and this piece can be thrown away

5. Using a soldering iron or pliers, push the thereaded insert into the hole at the top of the Barrel Holder.
Make sure it doesnt get in the way of pusshing the aluminum barrel all the way through the barrel holder.

7. Push the Pusher into the hole at the front of the plunger tube assembly (it might need to be deburred).
It is very important that the pusher is centered with the barrel, so test fit the assembly in the blaster and use shims (I used painters tape) to align the pusher. 
You can use a little hot glue on the underside of the flange to create a better seal once it is aligned.

8. Place the Mag Tooth into the back of the Mag Adapter and place the assembly into the blaster.
The Mag Adapter will lock over a small feature in the side wall of the stampede and the Mag Tooth will slot into the same screw posts as the original, as can be seen in the above photo.

9. Now would be a good time to rewire the blaster and replace the white trigger lever with the printed one.
Note that this means the blaster does not have any form of cycle control, this is because when using a 4S battery the blaster can have runaway firing issues.
If you can impliment motor braking the printed trigger lever does not need to be installed and the stock lever can be used.

10. Screw the barrel holder in place with the dart gate screws, place the aluminium barrel into the barrel holder, and align it with the mag adapter as shown in the photo above.
Once aligned tighten the 3M screw that goes into the threaded insert to lock the position of the aluminum barrel.
Make sure the screw is really tight as the stampede firing is very violent and can push the barrel back out of alignment.
